		"remarks" : "Charming and lovingly restored farmhouse just outside the Borough in the historic village of Mechanicsville, this fine property has all the modern amenities in a classic package. The original character of a Bucks County farmhouse abounds through the updated kitchen featuring exposed stone walls, Viking range, second oven and wide plank pine floors. Large dining and living rooms flow into the sun-filled family room and out onto the deck. Upstairs are three bedrooms, including the master suite with private full bath and laundry room. Proceeding through the grounds you will find two antique post and beam barns with electricity for garage space or storage, then a large detached office. Zoned village commercial, this additional 1600 sq ft building could be a great home office, workshop, or whatever fits your needs. Behind the office is a flat and open back yard. Plenty of space for a variety of needs, classic charm yet modern touches, this property has it all & is ready to go.",

Looking for a home with lots of living space inside AND outside? THEN THIS IS THE HOUSE FOR YOU!! This custom PA field stone, built-to-last home held a $1 million mortgage in 1995. Current kitchen & baths are clean & fully functional, but with some updating, you could bring this home back to $1MM+ value in 2014! Sitting on the highest point in Warwick Twp. with breathtaking views overlooking the hills of Doylestown & beyond, this home offers over 4,000 square feet on 2+ acres. Whether you need 4 bdrms or up to 6 bdrms, this could be the home for you & your family to spread out in. Custom woodworking & built-in cabinets in many rooms, recently refinished oak hardwood flooring on the main & 2nd floors. Quality built construction throughout is what you will find in this home...they just don't build homes like this anymore! The kitchen, L/R & D/R have all been freshly painted & feature real solid wood, hand crafted, woodwork & built-in cabinets. A large, stone wood burning fireplace surrounded by built in cabinetry fill the main L/R wall. The kitchen is large with a separate butler's pantry (both freshly painted & with new flooring); the butler's pantry opens into the D/R. Together, this large 1st floor space would make entertaining a breeze either as it is, or if converted into a fully open concept entertaining space. Large rooms & huge closets exists throughout the home. There is a 1st floor office/den just in from the front door with built-in shelves & large closet. Two large bedrooms & two full bathrooms on the first level make in-law accommodations a possibility. Two addt'l very large bedrooms & one full bath are on the 2nd level, as well as a large cedar closet, & a large bonus room that could be used as an addt'l bedroom, home office, or upstairs den for those in need of extra space. The finished basement includes a 2nd kitchen, powder room (with plenty of space to add a tub or shower if needed), a large bar area, & a huge F/R with Mercer tile fireplace, ceramic tile floor, & solid oak custom paneling.

As you come through the front door you will see the formal living rm and dining rm with hardwood floors, built-in floor to ceiling colonial shelving and a decorative fireplace and crown molding and chair rails. The kitchen has not only been redone but enlarged over time.  There are cherry cabinets and granite counters as well as an island work area, double sink and glass top cook-top plus a pantry. The family room is open off the kitchen and has a raised brick hearth fireplace, beamed ceiling and lovely bow window. What a wonderful place to relax and put your feet up. The family room goes out to a screened in porch for your summer evenings and entertaining.  All the baths in the house have been updated and the 2nd floor has hardwood and very generous sized bedrooms.  The basement is partially finished and the laundry is on the first floor.  This home has what you need.",

		"remarks" : "A home is a place where memories are sown, a place where they are lovingly tended and allowed to grow, until they fill the space with such warmth and love that it shines through the windows and calls you to come inside. Years of memories have been made in these large rooms with wonderful  additions like the 600SF outdoor pavilion with electric, the composite wrap around deck and the patio with fountain-parties and weddings have happened here. A composite deck and wide patio with the tiered Italianesque fountain has been a great place for toy boats to play. The center hall entry is flanked by the formal living room and dining room. The living room features boxed ceiling molding and the dining room, chair rail and crown molding. Through to the updated kitchen with center island, pantry and expansive counter tops. A six seat table has plenty of space in the breakfast room. Wood trimmed French doors lead to the family room with brick fireplace and double French doors-one set to the game room with terra cotta floors and walls of windows and one to the sunroom with wood trimmed casement windows and beamed ceiling. A large laundry/mudroom and half bath complete the first floor. On the second floor wide open landing opens to five spacious bedrooms. Each bedroom has it's own character, sunny windows and lots of closet space. A center bath with double sink and ceramic tiled tub/shower combination has a large linen closet. The Master bedroom features beautiful custom built in cabinetry and shelving. A large room, the master also has a walk in closet and dressing room as well as a full master bath. Additionally there is a full unfinished walk out basement and a two car oversized garage with separate outdoor entrance. Ten acres of lash lawn, half a mile stone path and nature trail, peace and quiet and nothing but the sounds of the birds and the water splashing in the fountain as you relax on the deck. This is a ten acre paradise only minutes from Dublin and Doylestown Boroughs and Lake Galena!",

Separate door to outside on this level. 3 year old well pump with acid neutralizing system on, radon system in place, and less than 1 year old LG washer and dryer. Home was recently surveyed and part of side yard would be nice for swing sets or recreational area. Two car attached garage with inside access plus plenty of parking in the newly repaved driveway with paver retaining walls which have built-in lighting for the evening. PUBLIC SEWER and private well make this an awesome choice!

		"remarks" : "Five bedroom, 2.1 Bath. Early nineteenth century stately stone manor home in Buckingham, PA. Its Federalist-style facade boasts an elegant front door with Palladian window and is pictured in several Bucks County farmhouse books.  A large, gracious entry hall opens to two large living rooms each with a fireplace and original hand-carved mantels, huge windows and high ceilings.  The dining room has a walk-in, stone fireplace and exposed wooden ceiling.  Ascend the grand staircase in the main hall, or escape up the spiral, wooden staircase off the dining room to access four more bedrooms on the second floor.   Two are matching with fireplaces and the continuation of large windows and wide floor planking. On the third floor is a large attic bedroom, with dormer windows and plenty of storage space.  Don't miss the secret powder room built under the grand staircase.  A FREE STANDING STUDIO COTTAGE (over 300 sq. ft.) with full bath, kitchenette and sleeping loft allows for many uses in the Village Residential zoning district. The property includes a BARN for additional parking, and backs on to 50 acres of preserved open space.",

It seeks a new owner who will give it the commanding presence it once had on its sizable corner lot. Being sold as-is, this architecturally engaging structure has several possibilities: upgrade the current units and maintain it as a rental property; restore it to a grand single-family house; or completely reconfigure it to become a two-unit with owner's quarters on the top two floors and a rental on the first level. New roof 2011. Details of present apartments include: A bi-level 2BR/1BA on the second and third floors with hardwood floors, substantial moldings, washer/dryer, galley kitchen, dining room, living room, ample storage, high ceilings; a 1BR/1BA on first floor with high ceilings, hardwood floors under new carpet; a studio on first floor. Each unit has its own entrance; two presently are electric heat and one is oil-fired hot water, though all could be converted back to hot water. An increasingly rare opportunity in the Borough on a  large parcel with excellent walkability to the center of town as well as a train commuter's dream, where a hop, skip and a jump gets you to the platform.",
